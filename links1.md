## 📁LINKS TO OTHER FILES📁
Having this "hipertext" feature, is something interesting and very useful, for example, when doing indexes. We can make reference to other md files withing a folder or a same project... or from a URL (wether it is from a URL of an image, a google drive file, etc).

## 🔤SYNTAX🔤

In order to make reference to files within the same carpet or project, use the next syntax: `[TITLE](SRC FILE)`

for example:
**[INDEX]\(./README.md)**

will direct you to the README file that has the index of this branch:

[INDEX](./README.md)
