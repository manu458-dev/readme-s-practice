## 📝 LISTS 📝
In MarkDown, we have 2 main types of lists (a 3rd one would be the nested one): `ordered` and `unordered` lists

## 📄 ORDERED LISTS 📄
We can list the items with it's corresponding number: `1. Item`... But you can also use just a number, and MD will order automatically the list: `0. Item1 0.item2`...

So:

"1. Item1"
"2. Item2"
"3. Item3"

It's them same as:

"2. Item1"
"2. Item2"
"2. Item3"

or

"0. Item1"
"0. Item2"
"0. Item3"

##  📜 UNORDERED LISTS 📜
On the other hand, we have those lists that does not have a specific order, so we can just put things withing the list. To do that, we can use one of these three characters: `+` `-` `*`

For instance:
"* Item 1"

"+ Item 1"

"- Item 1"

## 📄📜NESTED LISTS 📜📄
Things now are comming more interesting, we can use both of the previous worlds to make more interesting lists.

In order to make these, we have to add a tab just below the line we want to nest.

For instance:

"* Item1"
"----* Subitem1"
"----* Subitem2"

A real example (yes, it is a mess):

* ITEM1 (ul)
    * SUBITEM 1 (ul)
    0. SUBITEM 2 (ol)
    0. ITEM2 (ol)
0. ITEM2 (ol)
    0. SUBITEM 1 (ol)
    * SUBITEM 2 (ul)
    0. SUBITEM 3 (ol)
0. ITEM 3

**notes:**
* **the lines -- represent a tab (xd)**
* ***ul* = unordered list; *ol* = ordered list**
