We can add images to make our MK more beatiful. There are two main ways to add images: from a local folder o project (relative paths) or from an URL (image URL or google drive)


##### FIRST IMAGE (LOCAL FOLDER)
The syntax would be the next: `[ALT TEXT]\(SRC IMG)`

for instance: `![CRUNCHY CAT](./assets/images/told-you-so-crunchyCatLuna-small.jpg)`

![CRUNCHY CAT](./assets/images/told-you-so-crunchyCatLuna-small.jpg)


##### SECOND IMAGE (URL IMAGE)
The syntax would be the next: `[ALT TEXT]\(URL IMG)`

for instance: `![CRUNCHY CAT](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/25/c5/9b/25c59b75a14c99842477ba8a8c1847e8.jpg?nii=t)`

#### THIRD IMAGE (DRIVE IMAGE)
**Work in progres**
